# RetroFPS-LevelEditor

Level Editor desktop app for my [RetroFPS game](https://github.com/mmmdule/RetroFPS).

The app allows map creation with many customization options planned. Configure each level's layout, textures, enemy and pickup placement and much more with great ease.

## Planned features
- Graphical grid display of map layouts
- Simple and accessible user interface
- Parameter customization (health, patrol range, damage...) for every object on the map
- Quick Export mode for in-game map testing
- Map grouping into Level Packs/Editor Projects.

## Screenshots
Current grid display with enabled draw, scroll and zoom in/out features.
